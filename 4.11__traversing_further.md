## Sept 2022

Issues with ```ssh``` connection to our work host persist - although we can make it to the gates, we can't get home. Assuming this is a result of system downstairs mixup during 22.04 installation. So start again.

```
sudo apt-get remove openssh-server openssh-client

sudo apt-get install openssh-server openssh-client 

# have a luuk
man sshd_config

# backup
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.original
sudo chmod a-w /etc/ssh/sshd_config.original

# edit the sshd_config, sudo nano etc

# set the banner to display at login, resisting slide into verbosity
Banner /etc/issue.net

# BEFORE RESTARTING, test the config to make sure its sane
sudo sshd -t -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# or whathaveyou, then save and restart
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service

# authorised keys are actually those of our home-grown champion, adjutant. Move those keys over, correct the permissions:
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_homegrown   # only author can only read/w
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_homegrown.pub   # anyone can read, author can write

# propegateway, note you specify the private key
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_homegrown author@gateway

```

Hopefully that **extremely specific** solution is of use to you. If not - back to bed.
