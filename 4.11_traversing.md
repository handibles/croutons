# SSH: traversing 4.11

What we want: 

	1	login from "hometop" to "worktop" across intermediate points (jumps) in the campus network 
	2	do it as quickly / as little effort as possible

Do this by (only need to do these once):

	1	configuring an SSH client at each  _user_profile_  in the chain
	2	making an ssh key at each computer
	3	use keys to skip need for login passwords 
	4	set a handy shortcut to establish the connection 


Connection looks like below: we need to configure each connection (e.g. 2 connection points below to configure) the first time only; thereafter we simply use them.

	{ home @ 143.239.000.000 }--->  { jump @ 143.239.111.111 }--->  { work @ 143.239.222.222 }


__Cautionary:__ I honestly can't speak to the security of this: such an obvious route is probably open to abuse by the malign, although we tend to assume the internal network is a safe place to be. Our admins are the people to ask about this, and any input is welcome. Remember the visibility of any info, keys, or terminal history you store, and the possibly large time window which someone would have to access it.

There are also graphical ssh connections (_a la_ ```teamviewer```) - haven't figured these out yet.



## Quickstart

Simply hop from one server to the next, making keys, copying keys forward, then logging in

### Quick 1
```
# configure, first time only:

# ------- start at home ----

:$ sudo apt-get open-ssh
:$ ssh-keygen
:$ ssh-copy-id jump@143.239.111.111
:$ ssh jump@143.239.111.111

# ------- login to jump(s) ----

:$ ssh-keygen
:$ ssh-copy-id work@143.239.222.222
:$ ssh work@143.239.222.222

# ------- login to work, do work! --

```
### Quick 2
```
# second time: two jumps in one, much faster

# ------- start at home ----
ssh -t -A jump@143.239.111.111 \
                ssh -t -A work@143.239.222.222 \
                screen -DR home_jump_work_ssh
                
# ------- now in work, do work! -----

```

## Walkthrough

	~	get an ssh client
	*	make ssh keypairs for each user profile in the chain
	*	register each user with the user they will be connecting to
	*	set an alias for connecting


### 0 - get an SSH client

[```Putty / mobaxterm / cygwin``` etc are programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_clients) running an ssh client, often ```open-ssh```. Ubuntu will have this already. You probably have one and don't need to do this. __Note:__ all these commands are based on open-ssh, other commands _might_ vary a bit (but not much?).

```
$ sudo apt-get openssh-client
```

### 1 - generate your public/private key

Keys are more secure AND speed things up AND remove the need for password prompts. At each connection point, we add the current user's public key to our destination user's authorised key list, then log in. 
Setting passphrases is not required, but does makes things more secure, but also will require you to enter the passphrase everytime you jump from profile to profile. You can add/remove passphrases by regenerating your keys at any time, but you'll need to recopy the new keys to your destination user profiles. Also, connection is a one way street: to connect in the "opposite direction" you'll need to config that separately. 

```
# don't worry if it doesn't look exactly like this! keyart is cool but not necessary

$ ssh-keygen

> Generating public/private rsa key pair.
> Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):      
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
> Enter same passphrase again: 
> Your identification has been saved in /home/home/.ssh/id_rsa.
> Your public key has been saved in /home/home/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
> The key fingerprint is:
> SHA256:e5its4MOJwx1BGbLFmE5J4QaFWCqYXQEppw+BakII7s home@143.239.000.000
> The key's randomart image is:
> +---[RSA 2048]----+
> |.O**O+.          |
> |%.==++.          |
> |OO .=+.          |
> |O..o .           |
> |.+.     S        |
> |E .o     =       |
> |    + ..+ o      |
> |     +. oo       |
> |     .. o+       |
> +----[SHA256]-----+
```


### 2 - copy keys forward, and test connection to your destination

Enter your pass __phrase__ to unlock your user's key (if set), and then the user pass __word__ for the computer you're logging in to. This adds the key in the format "```<looong string> user@hometop```" to ```~/.ssh/authorised_keys``` (can check this with ```head ~/.ssh/authorised_keys``` )

```
:$ ssh-copy-id jump@143.239.111.111
```

Then try logging in. If you didnt set a passphrase but still need to enter your password, make sure the destination user's ssh is set up.

```
:$ ssh jump@143.239.111.111
```

Keep logging in and copying keys until you get to your destination. To quit, just type exit. 


### 3 - setup an alias, avoid typing

Each user has a variety of files in their home directory that load presets/shortcuts etc: use this to include a handy shortcut for connecting. The shortcut is simply a bash command linked to an '```alias```' term - entring the words runs that command. Note : this assumes you're in an ubuntu env: ```mobaxterm/cygwin/putty``` are likely to have an equivalent way of adding shortcuts/aliases - have a check. For logging in to '```user```' at address ```143.239.111.111```, the alias "```gogogo```" would look like:

```
  # shortcut for user@hometop
	alias gogogo='ssh jump@143.239.111.111'

  # make shortcut for jump@jumptop
	alias gogogo='ssh work@143.239.222.222'
```

This requires a shortcut in each user profile. You can give ssh a command to run when it logs in, so instead, set a shortcut that chains these ssh commands together. There are also flags here that ensure we get a "proper" terminal session (```-t```), and ```-A``` to requiring fewer passphrase unlocks. Here, the ```\``` allows you to stick in ```newline``` without affecting the code, for legiility:

```
	alias gogogo='ssh -t -A jump@143.239.111.111 \
                ssh -t -A worktop@143.239.222.222'
```

Finally: throw some ```screen``` magic on, so that it always logs into the same session (or retrieves it if it already exists). You can always detach from this screen session when you get there (```Ctrl+A; d```) or remove the "```-DR```" (forcibly attach if it exists, create if not) and nickname ("```home_jump_work_ssh```") from the command to make a new screen session everytime.

```
  alias gogogo='ssh -t -A jump@143.239.111.111 \
                ssh -t -A worktop@143.239.222.222 \
                screen -DR home_jump_work_ssh'
```

To add one of these shortcuts, we could run ```nano``` on ```~/.bashrc```, scroll to the bottom, and add that command, then "reload" ```.bashrc``` by re-sourcing it with "```.```":
```
:$ nano ~/.bashrc    # add the command, ctrl+o to save, ctrl+x to quit

:$ . ~/.bashrc       # note the "." at the start
```

If feeling lucky, could simply append it to your .bashrc in one go, but __please make sure__ you're using two arrows, "```>>```" to not nuke the file altogether:
```
:$ echo -e "\n\nalias gogogo='ssh user@143.239.111.111'" >> ~/hey
```

Once these steps are set up, you should be able to travel directly from ```X``` to ```Y``` by typing e.g. ```gogogo```.
